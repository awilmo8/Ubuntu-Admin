"sudo apt-get install tasksel && sudo tasksel" then use the tasksel menu to install your desktop
- you need a display manager and a GUI. display managers include 
	- GDM3 (default, heavy resources)
	- SDDM
	- SLiM
	- LightDM (utilized by MATE) 
 - tasksel will install both based on which GUI you chose. 


17JUL22 - lightdm doesn't want to run, giving "lightdm.service failed with result exit-code"
LXDE, uses lightdm
run lxd using "sudo lxd" 
failed, "LXD is already running" 
warning, "instance type not operational" driver=qemu err="KVM support is missing (no /dev/kvm)" type=virtual-machine 
- error went away by creating /dev/kvm
- upon reboot, /dev/kvm was gone. still not loading
used tasksel to remove LXDE
ran "sudo apt-get install xfce4 slim" to get something working 
- 3 display managers are already installed - SDDM, LightDM, SLiM. had to choose one for default, chose SDDM
- tty1 still stuck on boot menu :(

nuke and start over, or continue troubleshooting?
