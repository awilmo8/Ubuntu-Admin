cloudinit hangs on ubuntu VM - disable early boot cloud-init with "sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled"
- doesn't get hung up on cloud-init now but wont boot GUI. stuck at "Finished Record Runlevel Change in UTMP" 
- similar to https://askubuntu.com/questions/1333240/ubuntu-20-04-server-blocks-at-boot-cloud-init-and-login
- tty1 still wont get past the boot sequence. can access other terminals
- seems it was a bad install, a new identical virtual machine boots up correctly without fixing the cloud-init issue
	- new VM is generation 2, not 1. could be related being that its modern Ubuntu 
- remember, VMs are cattle, not pets! 


add GUI to server - "sudo apt-get install tasksel && sudo tasksel" then use the tasksel menu to install your desktop
 - see GUI notes
