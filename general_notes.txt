cloudinit hangs on ubuntu VM - disable early boot cloud-init with "sudo touch /etc/cloud/cloud-init.disabled"
- doesn't get hung up on cloud-init now but wont boot GUI. stuck at "Finished Record Runlevel Change in UTMP" 


add GUI to server - "sudo apt-get install tasksel && sudo tasksel" then use the tasksel menu to install your desktop
